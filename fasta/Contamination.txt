[] We ran your sequences through our Contamination Screen. The screen found 
contigs that need to be trimmed and/or excluded. The results are in the 
Contamination.txt file posted in your submission on the WGS submission portal 
https://submit.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/subs/genome/.  

GenBank staff will automatically remove contaminants that are found to be 
the entire sequence or at the end of a sequence, and will post the reports 
and edited fasta file to the submission portal. Note that internal contamination 
will not be automatically removed since the sequence may be misassembled and 
therefore should be split at the contamination and resubmitted as separate sequences.
In addition, we do not automatically remove mitochondrial sequences in 
eukaryotic submissions. 

If you selected the submission portal option "Do not automatically trim or 
remove sequences identified as contamination" then you will need 
to adjust the sequences appropriately and then resubmit your sequences. 
After you remove the contamination, trim any Ns at the ends of the sequence 
and remove any sequences that are shorter than 200 nt and not part of a 
multi-component scaffold.

Note that mismatches between the name of the adaptor/primer identified in the screen 
and the sequencing technology used to generate the sequencing data should not be used 
to discount the validity of the screen results as the adaptors/primers of many 
different sequencing platforms share sequence similarity.



Contamination Results:


Screened 2,153 sequences, 1,311,288,680 bp.
Note: 1 sequence with runs of Ns 10 bp or longer was split before screening.
1 sequence with locations to mask/trim

Trim:
Sequence name, length, span(s), apparent source
